# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

For this project, I took on the role as an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates though an app. Instacart aleady had very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about thier sales patterns. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segementation based on the provided criteria.
