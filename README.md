# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

For this project, I took on the role as an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates though an app. Instacart aleady had very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about thier sales patterns. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segementation based on the provided criteria.

## Context

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

## Data

This project uses a customer dataset that was created and included for the purpose of this project, as well as number of open-source data sets from Instacart. These open-source data sets include data on:
- Grocery products
- Grocery departments
- Instacart orders

## Scripts and Documentation

The attached scripts are all in the format of Jupyter notebooks and include all code used for the analysis. In addition to these scripts, a final summary report, as well as all data vidualization files have been included for review.
